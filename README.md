# Not-Your-Typical-Recruiter
Hi there, I‚Äôm Anna (Malaysia Based) - A Passionate Recruiter Empowering Talent and Transforming Careers

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I‚Äôm thrilled to share a bit about my journey as a recruiter, where my passion for connecting talent with opportunity fuels my daily work.


# My Story
From the early days of my career, I was captivated by the potential of people. I saw how the right job could transform lives, and that fascination led me to the field of recruitment. My name is Anna Rusly, and I‚Äôve been a recruiter for over a decade, dedicated to bridging the gap between incredible talent and the organizations that need them. I would say that I am like a talent magnet, with a knack for finding the perfect puzzle piece for every job opening.


# A Journey of Discovery and Growth
I began my career as recruiter in 2010 , where I quickly discovered my knack for understanding people‚Äôs strengths and aligning them with the right opportunities. This realization sparked a new passion in me, and I made the leap into recruitment.

Over the years, I‚Äôve had the privilege of working with diverse teams and industries, from startups to established enterprises. Each experience has refined my approach, allowing me to develop a keen eye for identifying potential and a strategic mindset for recruitment processes.


# What I Do
In my role as a recruiter, I wear many hats:

‚Ä¢	Talent Scout: I actively search for and engage with top talent across various channels. My goal is to build a network of skilled professionals who are eager to make an impact.

‚Ä¢	Connector: I facilitate meaningful connections between candidates and organizations. By understanding both parties‚Äô needs and aspirations, I ensure a match that‚Äôs beneficial for both sides.

‚Ä¢	Strategist: I work closely with companies to develop and execute effective recruitment strategies. Whether it‚Äôs refining job descriptions, optimizing recruitment processes, or advising on market trends, my approach is always data-driven and results-oriented.

‚Ä¢	Advisor: I provide guidance to candidates throughout the hiring process, offering support from resume crafting to interview preparation. My mission is to help individuals present their best selves and achieve their career goals.


# Tools & Technologies

To stay ahead in this ever-evolving field, I leverage a variety of tools and technologies:

‚Ä¢	Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): I utilize tools like SAP Successfactor & Rymnet to streamline the recruitment process and maintain organized candidate records.

‚Ä¢	Recruitment Platforms: I actively use LinkedIn, Jobstreet, GitHub for sourcing candidates and expanding my professional network.


# My Philosophy
At the heart of my recruitment practice is a simple belief: Great talent can transform any organization, and the right opportunity can change a person‚Äôs life. This philosophy drives me to approach every task with enthusiasm, integrity, and a commitment to excellence.
